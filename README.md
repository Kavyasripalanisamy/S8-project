**REAL TIME ANOMALY DETECTION USING WEARABLE SENSOR**

 
 This project aims to develop a real-time anomaly prediction system utilizing wearable sensor data through machine learning techniques. Building upon our previous work in Parkinson's disease
prediction from gait analysis using Hidden Markov Models (HMM), the current project focuses on extending the applicability of wearable sensor technology for early detection of anomalies in
various contexts.
   -Detects the Parkinsonâ€™s disease from gait analysis using Hidden Markov Models (HMM), extending the applicability of wearable sensor technology for early detection of anomalies in various contexts. 
   Predict the abnormal patterns indicative of potential health issues or irregular activities.
   -An intuitive web application interface was developed using Flask, a Python web framework, allowing users to interact with the system, input their sensor data, and receive real-time predictions for
   Parkinson's disease detection. The interface enhances accessibility and usability for both healthcare professionals and patient.
   -Expanding the scope of sensor data collection to include a broader range of physiological signals and biometric data could enhance the comprehensiveness and specificity of the anomaly detection system.
